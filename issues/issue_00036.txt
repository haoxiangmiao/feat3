FULL TEXT
re-think the way certain global defines are provided. Currently, there is
a lot of potentially redundant code in our self-defined cmake-modules and
in the bease-header subsystem:
* Compiler version detection is implemented twice
* Not all defines provided in the cmake-generated feast_config and base-headers
are unique.

Reporter's note: Let's try to build up a critical mass of code first, and then
sync up the implementation as soon as we have a clearer idea which of our
global defines are needed at which stage in the toolchain process.
