FULL TEXT
When using MPICH2 the function ProcessGroup::log_indiv_master() is defective: the (screen+file) output the master should produce vanishes. With OpenMPI everything works fine.

SOLUTION
This bug magically vanished. Either due to Dirk's fix of an invalid pointer access (commit de205e4b586e5091e9b723c883cd389eb9afdc5b) or due to the general program reorganisation done by Hilmar.
