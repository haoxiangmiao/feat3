FULL TEXT
Separate load balancer process and coordinator process. In the case, there is a dedicated load balancer (which might perform some extra computations in parallel) it is not clever to let this process also be the coordinator of the process group.

SOLUTION
Coordinator process is always the process with rank 0 within the process group. If the load balancer is NOT a dedicated process, it coincides with the coordinator process, otherwise it is the process with the highest rank in the process group.
