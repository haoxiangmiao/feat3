FULL TEXT
Extend logger functionalities:
  * Currently, log files are simply written to the folder from which the program is started. There must be some way for the user to set a log directory where all log files are created in.
  * Introduce log levels and log categories. For example something like this:
    - log levels 0 (error), 1 (warning), ..., 4 (unimportant)
    - categories ASSEMBLY, SOLVER, LOADBALANCER, ...
    - The user sets (via configuration file): I want to see only error messages about matrix assembly (ASSEMBLY 0), I want to see everything about the solving process (SOLVER 4), and the important messages of the load balancing process (LOADBALANCER 2)
