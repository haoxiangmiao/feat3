FULL TEXT
The manager class - functioning as "interface" between application code and kernel -  will tend to blow up since nearly all kernel functions to be used in application code have to be "passed" through this interface. So, it might make sense, to diversify the manager class, i.e., build "manager categories" (in terms of derived classes) like "ManagerSolver", "ManagerAssembly", ...
