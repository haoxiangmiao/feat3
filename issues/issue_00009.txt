FULL TEXT
A better distinction between load-balancing and flow-control is needed. Currently, both is mixed.

SOLUTION
The former LoadBalancer class is now called Manager, and a dummy LoadBalancer class has been created. The latter does not contain any useful data or routines yet. All load balancing functionality, however, will be implemented in this class.
