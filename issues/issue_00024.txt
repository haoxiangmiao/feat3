FULL TEXT
Before definig an appropriate ASCII-file format and implementing the necessary infrastructure (see issue00018), we need a preliminary version:
  * read key-value pairs from one ASCII file "feast.ini"
  * store the information in some simple structure
  * There will be some mandatory keys. If these are not present in the file, an exception is thrown.

SOLUTION
